AI agents are autonomous software entities that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals with minimal human intervention. Unlike simple assistants, AI agents can plan multi-step tasks, manage state and memory, coordinate with other agents, and interact with tools, APIs, or systems to execute complex workflows. They often operate within defined constraints and policies, enabling them to handle dynamic scenarios such as lead qualification, process automation, monitoring, and optimization, while continuously adapting their behavior based on outcomes and context.
