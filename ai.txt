An AI assistant is a software system designed to understand user input, reason over information, and perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously to support users in their daily work. It combines natural language understanding, contextual memory, and task execution to answer questions, generate content, automate workflows, and integrate with external tools or systems. Modern AI assistants can operate across multiple channels, adapt to user intent in real time, and improve responses through feedback and learning, making them valuable for customer support, productivity, data analysis, and decision-making.
